# Physics Overview

This document explains the physics behind evenHorizon at an accessible level,
then gives the exact equations implemented in the code.

## Plain language

A black hole warps space so severely that light doesn't travel in straight
lines. Each ray of light curves around the black hole following a path called
a **geodesic**. The accretion disk -- a flat ring of hot glowing gas orbiting
the black hole -- appears distorted:

- The **back half** of the disk is bent up and over the top, creating a
  bright arc above the black hole (the "hat" shape).
- **One side is much brighter** than the other because gas on the approaching
  side is Doppler-boosted (like a siren getting louder as it approaches).
- A faint **ghost image** appears below the black hole from light that
  traveled around the back.

This is what Luminet computed by hand in 1979 and what evenHorizon
reproduces numerically.

## Spacetime

We use the **Schwarzschild metric** (non-rotating black hole) in geometric
units where G = c = 1:

```
ds^2 = -(1 - 2M/r) dt^2 + (1 - 2M/r)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 dOmega^2
```

Key radii with M = 1:

| Radius | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| r = 0 | Singularity | Point of infinite curvature |
| r = 2M | Event horizon | Point of no return for anything |
| r = 3M | Photon sphere | Unstable circular photon orbit |
| r = 6M | ISCO | Innermost stable circular orbit; inner edge of the disk |

The accretion disk is modelled as infinitely thin, lying in the equatorial
plane from r = 6M to r = 50M.

## Step 1: Impact parameter (gravitational lensing)

For each point on the disk at radius r and azimuthal angle alpha, we need
to find the **impact parameter** b -- the perpendicular distance between
the light ray and the black hole in flat space. This determines where the
point appears on the observer's image plane.

### Luminet's equation 13

The emission angle gamma relates the disk point to the observer:

```
cos(gamma) = cos(alpha) / sqrt(cos^2(alpha) + 1/tan^2(i))
```

where i is the observer inclination.

The impact parameter is found by solving an implicit equation involving
**elliptic integrals**. For a photon with closest approach (periastron) P:

```
b = sqrt(P^3 / (P - 2M))
```

The deflection angle as a function of P involves the complete and incomplete
elliptic integrals of the first kind:

```
gamma = 2 * sqrt(P/Q) * [F(zeta_inf, k^2) - F(zeta_r, k^2)]  (direct image)
gamma = 2 * sqrt(P/Q) * [2K(k^2) - F(zeta_inf, k^2) + F(zeta_r, k^2)]  (ghost image)
```

where:
- Q = sqrt((P - 2M)(P + 6M))
- k^2 = (Q - P + 6M) / (2Q)
- zeta_inf = arcsin(sqrt((Q - P + 2M) / (Q - P + 6M)))

We solve this numerically: scan over periastron values, find sign changes
in the residual of eq. 13, then refine by bisection to find the exact P
that matches the required deflection angle. This is done in
`_calc_enhanced_impact_parameter_exact()`.

### Coordinate transformation

The impact parameter b and angle alpha are converted to Cartesian observer
coordinates with a 90-degree rotation:

```
X = b * cos(alpha - pi/2)
Y = b * sin(alpha - pi/2)
```

---

## Step 2: Redshift (Luminet's equation 19)

The combined gravitational + Doppler redshift factor (1+z) determines how
much the light is dimmed or brightened:

```
(1 + z) = [1 + sqrt(M/r^3) * b * sin(i) * sin(alpha)] * [1 - 3M/r]^{-1/2}
```

Breaking this down:

- **Doppler term**: `1 + sqrt(M/r^3) * b * sin(i) * sin(alpha)`
  - sqrt(M/r^3) is the Keplerian orbital angular velocity
  - The product with b, sin(i), sin(alpha) gives the line-of-sight velocity
  - Positive for receding gas (redshift), negative for approaching (blueshift)

- **Gravitational term**: `[1 - 3M/r]^{-1/2}`
  - Always > 1 (gravitational redshift)
  - Diverges at r = 3M (photon sphere)

When (1+z) < 1, the light is blueshifted (brighter). When (1+z) > 1, it is
redshifted (dimmer). This is why the left side of the disk appears much
brighter than the right.

## Step 3: Intrinsic flux (Novikov-Thorne)

The intrinsic flux emitted at radius r uses the **Page-Thorne (1974)**
formula with the full logarithmic correction:

```
F_intrinsic = (3M * mdot) / (8 * pi) * 1/((r/M - 3) * r^{5/2}) *
              [sqrt(r/M) - sqrt(6) + (1/sqrt(3)) * ln(L)]
```

where:
```
L = [(sqrt(r/M) + sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(6) - sqrt(3))] /
    [(sqrt(r/M) - sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(6) + sqrt(3))]
```

This is zero at the ISCO (r = 6M) and peaks at around r = 9M.

### Observed flux

The observed flux includes the relativistic beaming law:

```
F_observed = F_intrinsic / (1 + z)^4
```

The fourth power comes from: one factor each for energy shift, time
dilation, solid angle compression, and frequency-to-frequency mapping.
This dramatically amplifies the approaching (blueshifted) side and
suppresses the receding side.

## Step 4: Ghost image

Light that passes behind the black hole and wraps around by more than
pi radians creates a secondary image. In the code this is the n=1 solution
to eq. 13. Ghost particles appear below the main disk (Y-flipped) and
are plotted with reduced opacity.

Ghost particles are filtered by the apparent inner edge: those inside
the lensed ISCO boundary form the inner ghost ring, those outside form
the outer ghost region. The two groups are rendered separately with
different opacity levels.

---

## Step 5: Black fill (apparent inner edge)

The black region in the centre is not a simple circle -- it is the
**gravitationally lensed apparent inner edge** of the disk. The code
traces this curve by computing the impact parameter for r = 6M at
200 angles around the disk, producing a teardrop-like shape that is
filled black.

## Rendering

### Contour mode (`luminet`)

Particles are assembled into a Delaunay triangulation and rendered with
`matplotlib.tricontourf` using the Greys_r colormap. Flux values are
power-scaled: `display = (flux/max_flux)^{power_scale}`.

### Scatter mode (`scatter`)

Each particle is drawn as a dot with the `hot` colormap. Dot size is
proportional to flux. This reveals the individual sampling structure
and is suitable for pen plotter export.

### Isoradial mode (`isoradials`)

Constant-radius curves are traced by computing the impact parameter at
many angles for each radius. These polylines are drawn in white and can
be exported as SVG paths or G-code toolpaths.
